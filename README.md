## Usage
``` 
    To start using this project: 

    1.  Install node modules for Fron-End and Back-End with: npm install
    2.  Create a .env file at the root location of the project to handle the database. There is an .env.example file for you to model.
    3. Also, at least in my case, I had to manually create the database with the specified name in MySQL in order for The application to be able to generate the tables and data. 
    4. This means if you are using a database editor such as DBeaver, connect to your localhost. Right click on the localhost icon, then click "Create" on the dropdown list, then click "Database". Name the database the exact name that you have specified in your .env file for your project.
```
